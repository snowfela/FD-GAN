# FD-GAN
 A PyTorch-based implementation of Forgery Detection using GANs (FD-GAN), designed to recover authentic images from forged ones. This module supports real-world applications in e-commerce, content validation, and multimedia analysis with a trained generative model for forgery-to-authenticity transformation.
